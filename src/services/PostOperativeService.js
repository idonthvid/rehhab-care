                            Neuro rehabilitation is the specialised process of helping the brain and nervous system recover after a stroke, paralysis, or other neurological event. It works on the principle of neuroplasticity — the brain's remarkable ability to rewire and rebuild connections when consistently stimulated through targeted movement and activity. Our physiotherapists are trained in neuro-specific techniques and design programmes that progressively restore movement, function, and independence in familiar home surroundings.
